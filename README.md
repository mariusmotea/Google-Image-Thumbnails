# Google-Images-Thumbnails
Download the thumbnails from 'Google Images' at fast speed

There are already severals tools available to download images from google, but i needed something that run much faster. To obtain this result i choose to convert all base64 thumbnails from returned google page into image files.

Run in Python3

example:

```
marius@XPS-13:~/$ python3 google_thumbnails.py "coca cola 0.5l"  
found 20 thumbnails
```
